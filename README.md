# Asteroids-Like-Arduino-Uno-Game
Made an asteroids inspired game on the Arduino Uno for use with a Waveshare 320x240 LCD display and a joystick.


The game code is LCD_code.ino, where GUI_Paint.cpp and GUI_Paint.h were the main display functions that were modified. They were taken from the display's official site https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2inch_LCD_Module
